/**
 * STRUCTURED ORDER STATE — the single, persisted source of truth for the order
 * the customer is building in a conversation.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Before this module the order facts (product, colour, size, quantity, phone,
 * address, payment method) were re-derived from the chat transcript on EVERY
 * agent run. Any run whose re-extraction came back thin — a stalled helper
 * call, a long conversation, a customer message that only says "تمام" — made
 * the agent forget a decision that had already been taken and ask for it
 * again, or re-open a question that was already settled.
 *
 * The state below is stored on the conversation row (`conversations.order_state`)
 * and carried across runs. A run may only ever ADD to it or UPGRADE a field's
 * stage. It can never blank a field because this turn's extraction missed it.
 *
 * Stages (a value alone is NOT proof it was agreed)
 * -------------------------------------------------
 *   extracted → understood from what the customer said this/earlier turns
 *   verified  → checked against live store data (variant exists, has stock,
 *               shipping zone is covered, phone/address are usable)
 *   confirmed → the customer explicitly agreed to it (or it survived the
 *               order summary confirmation)
 *   committed → actually written into an order row; immutable afterwards
 *
 * Pure module: no network, no database, no environment. Callers load and save
 * the JSON blob.
